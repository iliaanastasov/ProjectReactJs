A registered and logged in user should create a team selecting Name, kit and coaching style.
Users can pick 11 football players from the top 4 teams from England,Spain,Italy and Germany. 
at /addPlayer  user can add and remove player. Once there are 11 players added there will be an option to complete the team. 
When the team is completed user can check out each player score at /completedTeam.
There is a ranking for all who have createde their own team at /rankings.
